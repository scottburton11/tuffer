# Tuffer
A buffered command-line Twitter. What could possibly go wrong?

## Features
Tuffer currently has two features:

1. when you run it, it shows your tweets
2. if you type something under 140 characters and press Return, it'll
tweet it!

## Getting started
You'll need some Twitter app credentials, plus OAuth keys for your own
account. See [http://dev.twitter.com](dev.twitter.com) for details.

## Are you sure this is a good idea?
What made you think I thought this was a good idea?

## Seriously, wtf were you thinking?
I was thinking about The Rules:

* *Rule #1*: Always look cool
* *Rule #2*: Never forget Rule #1

## Knock it off
Fine, time to stop pretending to work anyway.
