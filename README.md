# Tuffer
A buffered command-line Twitter. What could possibly go wrong?

## Features
Tuffer currently has two features:
1. when you run it, it shows your tweets
2. if you type something under 140 characters and press Return, it'll
tweet it!

## Getting started
You'll need some Twitter app credentials, plus OAuth keys for your own
account. See [http://dev.twitter.com](dev.twitter.com) for details.
